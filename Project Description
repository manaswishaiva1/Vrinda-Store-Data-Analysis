This project involves analyzing the sales data of Vrinda Store to extract valuable business insights using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance for better business decision-making.

In this project, I performed data cleaning, data transformation, and analysis using several Excel tools and techniques. Key Excel skills applied include:

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for dynamic reporting

VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH for data lookup

IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF, and other logical functions for analysis

Data Validation to manage inputs

Conditional Formatting for data highlighting

Dashboard creation for visual presentation of insights

Sorting & Filtering large datasets

Charts & Graphs for data visualization


Major insights generated from the project include monthly sales trends, top-performing products, customer segmentation, region-wise sales distribution, and profit analysis. The final dashboard provides an interactive and visually appealing summary of the analysis for quick decision-making.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Excel data analysis, data visualization, problem-solving, and business analytics.
